Failed building wheel for pysam


## I am going to try skip pysam and install velocyto directly first to see whether it works

get similar error

## try another version of pysam

## try install pysam with htslib

export HTSLIB_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/local/lib
export HTSLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include
pip install pysam

## go to install hstlib 

http://www.htslib.org/download/

## then add the htslib/lib folder to LD_LIBRARY_PATH as described on the following website
https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam/issues/262

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:htslib/lib 
export HTSLIB_LIBRARY_DIR=htslib/lib
export HTSLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=htslib/include
pip install pysam

## try the pysam downloaded by anaconda
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda install pysam

## then I installed velocyto, run velocyto --help and got the error below
RuntimeError: 
Your current Python installation is affected by a critical bug in numpy and
MKL, and is going to return wrong results in velocyto and potentially other
scientific packages.

Please try updating your `numpy` version.

For more information, see
https://github.com/velocyto-team/velocyto.py/issues/104
and
https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/10089


## I updated my numpy through

pip install -U 
My numpy version changed from 1.14.3 to 1.15.2

## rerun velocyto --help
Got the following warning, but the program seems able to run
